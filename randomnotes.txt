Sorry, change the taxation again, so it goes as following:





1. 5% is taxed from the total of the Bruto salary (this is the pension fund where the company pays 5% and the worker pays the other 5%).

2. After the pension fund taxation is done, take the bruto amount left and do the actual tax of the state which is based on the following table:
- Loan from 0-80 € 0%
- Loan from 80 to 250EUR is taxed 4%.
- If it is more than 250EUR and up to 450EUR add the following taxation as well: 8%
If the salary is  above 450EUR add the following taxation as well: 10%
